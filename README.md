# gh-deploy-bot

This is a GitHub bot that simplifies the process of deployment for organizations from multiple interconnected repositories.

It listens certain [GitHub events](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/events) (pull request, commit) and triggers a new deployment to be created for defined applications.

That allows your dev team to develop and deploy their code to personal dev environments e.g. `https://pull-123.customer-domain.com` managed by Kubernetes.

## Setup

2. Install bot into kubernetes cluster using docker image: [infraway/gh-deploy-bot](https://hub.docker.com/r/infraway/gh-deploy-bot)
3. Follow install instructions inside the bot to conect it to GitHub organization.
4. Try to make a PR in a repository, that defined in the `config.yaml` file.
